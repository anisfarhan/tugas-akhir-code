# Thesis Guidelines: Algorithm Performance Analysis

## **Step 1: Define Your Research Scope**
### **Research Question:**
- Example: *How do different programming languages affect the performance of various algorithms in terms of time and space complexity?*
- Decide whether to analyze compiled vs. interpreted languages or low-level vs. high-level languages.

### **Select Algorithms & Scenarios:**
- Sorting
- Matrix Multiplication
- Integral/Modeling
- Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS)
- Knapsack/Longest Path
- String Matching
- Path-finding Algorithm
- Huffman Coding

### **Select Programming Languages:**
- Consider a mix of languages (e.g., C, C++, Java, Python, Go, Rust).
- Ensure representation of different paradigms (compiled, interpreted, functional, procedural).

---

## **Step 2: Literature Review & Related Work**
### **Research and Cite Sources:**
- Study previous works on algorithm performance.
- Understand how different languages handle memory, execution time, and optimizations.
- Use resources like Google Scholar, IEEE, ACM Digital Library.

---

## **Step 3: Experiment Design**
### **Standardize Input Data:**
- Define input sizes (small, medium, large).
- Use the same dataset for fairness.

### **Performance Metrics:**
- **Execution Time:** Measure runtime with high-precision timers.
- **Memory Usage:** Use built-in profilers (`valgrind`, `time`, `memory_profiler`).
- **Scalability:** Observe changes with increasing input size.

### **Implementation Rules:**
- Ensure identical logic across different languages.
- Avoid unfair optimizations that give one language an advantage.

---

## **Step 4: Implement & Run Experiments**
### **Write the Code:**
- Implement each algorithm in all selected languages.
- Use version control (GitHub/GitLab).

### **Test and Debug:**
- Ensure correctness before benchmarking.
- Start with small datasets and scale up.

### **Automate Benchmarking:**
- Use scripts to automate execution and data collection (Bash, Python).
- Log execution times and memory usage systematically.

---

## **Step 5: Data Collection & Analysis**
### **Run Experiments Multiple Times:**
- Take the **average** execution time over multiple runs.
- Test on different hardware configurations (if possible).

### **Visualize Results:**
- Use **Excel, Python (Matplotlib, Pandas), R** to create graphs.
- Compare execution time, memory usage, and scalability.

### **Identify Patterns & Insights:**
- Which language is the fastest?
- Which consumes the least memory?
- How do compiled vs. interpreted languages compare?

---

## **Step 6: Write the Thesis**
### **Standard Structure:**
1. **Introduction** â€“ Background, problem statement, research objectives.
2. **Literature Review** â€“ Related work, theories, and previous studies.
3. **Methodology** â€“ Experimental setup, programming languages, datasets, evaluation metrics.
4. **Implementation & Experiments** â€“ Description of code, testing process, performance metrics.
5. **Results & Discussion** â€“ Data analysis, comparison, and findings.
6. **Conclusion & Future Work** â€“ Summary, key takeaways, and suggestions for future research.

### **Use Proper Citations:**
- Use reference management tools like **Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote**.

### **Proofread & Get Feedback:**
- Ask your advisor or peers for reviews.
- Check for **clarity, coherence, and proper formatting**.

---

## **Step 7: Final Submission & Presentation**
### **Format Your Thesis Correctly:**
- Follow university guidelines for font, margins, citations.
- Convert to **PDF** for submission.

### **Prepare Your Thesis Defense:**
- Create slides summarizing key findings.
- Anticipate potential questions from examiners.

---

## **Bonus: Tools & Resources**
### **Programming:** Python, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Bash scripting  
### **Benchmarking Tools:** `time` (Linux), `cProfile` (Python), `Valgrind` (C++)  
### **Visualization:** Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Excel  
### **Version Control:** GitHub/GitLab  
### **Paper Search:** Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library
